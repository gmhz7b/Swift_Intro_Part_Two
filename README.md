# Swift Intro: Pt 2

### Objectives
- Continue discussing the semantics of the [Swift Programming Language](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/)
- Focus specifically on topics related to:
    - Control Flow
    - `struct`
    - `enum`
    - `class`

### Tasks
Review the lecture slides and complete the exercises outlined in `main.swift`.

### Notes
* Places where code should be implemented are marked with `TODO` comments and will appear as warnings in the Issue navigator when building the project
* A __SwiftLint__ build script has been added for convenience
